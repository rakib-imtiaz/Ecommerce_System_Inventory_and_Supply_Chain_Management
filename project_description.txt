Project Scope Overview:
    • Product and Inventory Management:
    • Product Information: The system maintains details on each product, including product ID, name, description, and price. Products are categorized, and discounts can be applied based on discount codes.
    • Inventory Tracking: Products are stocked in inventory, and the system keeps track of inventory levels across different warehouses and stores. Each inventory entry includes a unique inventory ID, quantity, and shipping date.
    • Supplier and Supplier Orders: The system allows for managing supplier information, including supplier name, contact info, and address. Supplier orders are recorded with expected delivery dates and statuses.
    • Customer Order and Returns Management:
    • Customer Orders: The system manages customer orders with information on order status and shipping details. Each order can contain multiple order items, including quantity and unit price.
    • Payments: Payment details are recorded for each order, covering the amount, payment date, and method.
    • Returns Management: Customers can return items, and the system tracks return status, reason, and date.
    • Employee and Role Management:
    • Employee Information: Employee details, such as name, date of birth, email, and hire date, are maintained. Employees can be assigned to specific roles and locations (store or warehouse).
    • Roles and Supervision: The system distinguishes between employees working in stores and warehouses, with hierarchical relationships (supervision) captured. Supervisors oversee other employees, with timeframes recorded for each supervisory relationship.
    • Store and Warehouse Management:
    • Store Locations: Information on stores, including type and location, is recorded. Products can be stocked at different stores for availability.
    • Warehouse Management: Warehouses are maintained with capacity details and warehouse location, supporting inventory storage and employee assignments.
    • Customer Engagement:
    • Reviews: Customers can write reviews on products, with each review associated with a date, rating, and text description. This enhances customer engagement and feedback.
